# Theme - Dracula

[Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme for Sublime Merge 2. It is based off the Sublime Mariana color scheme, but
uses the classic Dracula color palette.

Requires related [color scheme](https://github.com/facelessuser/sublime-dracula-scheme).

## Install

Assuming the required color scheme is installed, git clone project or download into your Sublime Merge `Packages`
folder as `Theme - Dracula`. Edit your merge `Preferences.sublime-settings` file to use the Dracula theme:

```js
    "theme": "Dracula.sublime-theme"
```

## Dracula Pro?

Dracula Pro changed up the color palette a bit and added new variants such as Buffy, Van Helsing, and others. Dracula
Pro is also not free. Because of this, we only provide the "classic" Dracula palette.

We'd love to provide Pro variants, but while we think we have figured out the color palette for new Pro variants,
without the Pro color scheme being made public, we do not feel it would be proper to release our variants here.

For those who've acquired Pro through purchasing, the current color scheme can be customized with overrides to provide
Pro styles.

If at some future time, the Pro public scheme becomes available to the public, we will be happy to provide theme
variants here as well.

## Customize

The theme changes dynamically based on the color scheme. In order to adjust the colors, simply override the color scheme
with your desired changes. See the color schemes [documentation](https://github.com/facelessuser/sublime-dracula-scheme).
