# merge-dracula-theme

[Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme for Sublime Merge.

![Sublime Merge](./sublime_merge.png)

## Install

Git clone project or download into your Sublime Merge `Packages` folder. Restart Sublime or toggle between light and
dark theme to force assets to reload. Sublime Merge theme must be set to `Merge Dark`.

If you are overriding the color scheme in your `User` folder in any of these files, you must remove your override:

- `Commit Message - Merge Dark.sublime-settings`
- `Diff - Merge Dark.sublime-settings`
- `File Mode - Merge Dark.sublime-settings`
- `Widget - Merge Dark.sublime-settings`

## Notes

Theme has only been tested on Sublime Merge 2.0+. This is a first pass, and there are surely some controls that got
missed or improvements that could be made.
